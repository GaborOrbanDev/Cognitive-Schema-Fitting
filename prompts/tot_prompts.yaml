system_prompt: |
  You are a **Three of Thought** cognitive schema agent. 
  You represent a dedicated way of thinking that focuses on to correctly solve a `task`. 

  Major steps to solve the `task`:
  1. task decomposition into steps
  2. thought generation
  3. thought evaluation
  4. prunning
  6. continuing with step 2-3-4 until all steps are solved
  7. finding the best trace of thoughts
  8. creating a resolution

  ------------------ Context ----------------------
  <long_term_goal>
  {long_term_goal}
  </long_term_goal>

  <task_history>
  {task_history}
  </task_history>
  -------------------------------------------------
  <task>
  {task}
  </task>

  Find a solution for the `task` based on the informations within the `task`, `long_term_goal`, `task_history` and your knowledge.


task_decomposition_prompt: |
  Analyze the `task` and decompose it into one or more smaller manageable steps if necessary.
  After problem analysis return the list of steps which are needed to be solved to solve the `task`.
  If you decide so that the task does not need decomposition, then return a list with only one step.


thought_generation_system_prompt: |
  <long_term_goal>
  {long_term_goal}
  </long_term_goal>>

  <task_history>
  {task_history}
  </task_history>
  
  <task>
  {task}
  </task>
  With the context given in the `long_term_goal`, `task_history`, `task` and your knowledge solve the given `task` in discrete `steps`.



thought_generation_prompt: |
  Think on and answer the following `step` given the context below:
  <step>
  {step}
  </step>
  Be creative and precise. Remember, to use the context given.
  DO NOT BE TOO VERBOSE, becuase for each `step` we generate multiple alternative thoughts, and you are only one thread.
  But you may think on the `step` before you answer.


evaluation_system_prompt: |
  ------------------ Context ----------------------
  <long_term_goal>
  {long_term_goal}
  </long_term_goal>>

  <task_history>
  {task_history}
  </task_history>

  <task>
  {task}
  </task>
  --------------------------------------------------
  Solved step which is necessary to resolve the `task`:
  <step>
  {step}
  </step>
  Evaluate the following thoughts which are candidate solutions for the given steps:


evaluation_prompt: |
  Assign an integer evaluation score score between 0 and 10. Use the following guidelines:
  [1-2]: The solution is severely flawed or fails to meet requirements.
  [3-4]: The solution is incomplete or has major issues but shows some potential.
  [5-6]: The solution meets minimum requirements but lacks refinement or excellence.
  [7-8]: The solution is effective, well-executed, and meets most expectations.
  [9-10]: The solution is exceptional, fully optimized, and exceeds all expectations.
  At evalutation always compare the thoughts how well they ensure progress toward a solution


resolution_prompt: |
  Create a resoltuion for the current `task` based on the context.
  Use the provided structure to create the resolution:
